# MOrg

*MOrg* is to be a tool for organizing mathematical thoughts. Primary
usage will be:

1.  Write a bunch of *articles* such as definitions, theorems,
    propositions, lemmas, and corollaries some of which may include
    proofs of them.
2.  Organize these articles into *sections* and then a *document*.
3.  Convert the document to LaTeX and then PDF.
4.  Generate from the document a website where each article has its
    own page.

All articles have unique and permanent *identifier*. Section and
article numberings may change when the document structure has changed,
but an identifier consistently refers to a particular article. This
system is the same as those of [The Stacks
project](https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/),
[Kerodon](https://kerodon.net/) and [Jon Sterlingâ€™s
Forest](https://forest.jonmsterling.com/).
