    It is not true that it is true that it is not true that it is true that it is not true that it is true that false is false.

  #:proof @proof[
    @paragraph{
      This essntially follows from @ref["0004"]. But we first have to observe that true is in fact false. Then, it follows that false is also false. Our claim is immediate from this.
